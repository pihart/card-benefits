/**
 * Model classes for the Credit Card Benefit Tracker.
 * 
 * This file exports all model classes in the correct order
 * to handle dependencies between classes.
 * 
 * Include this file in HTML after all individual model files:
 *   <script src="models/ExpiryCycle.js"></script>
 *   <script src="models/CarryoverCycle.js"></script>
 *   <script src="models/Benefit.js"></script>
 *   <script src="models/Card.js"></script>
 * 
 * Or simply include models.js which ensures proper ordering.

// Classes are defined in their own files and loaded via script tags.
// This file serves as documentation and could be used for module bundling in the future.
